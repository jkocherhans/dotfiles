# This comes from installing mysql-client with brew

# mysql-client is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because it conflicts with mysql (which contains client libraries).
# If you need to have mysql-client first in your PATH run:

export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"


# For compilers to find mysql-client you may need to set:

export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/include"


# For pkg-config to find mysql-client you may need to set:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/lib/pkgconfig"
